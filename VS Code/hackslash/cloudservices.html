    <p class="heading">CLOUD SERVICES</p>

<p class="first"> What are Cloud Services? </p>
  <p class="second">Cloud services are application and infrastructure resources that exist on the Internet. Third-party providers contract with subscribers for these services, allowing customers to leverage powerful computing resources without having to purchase </p>
<p class="third">or maintain hardware and software.</p>

<p class="para1">When you use cloud services, you are able to hand off managing infrastructure and focus instead on just using it. The provider you choose will support a wide range of activities that keep your business operating, such as application processing and exchange, storage, and management of your data.</p>
</div>
<div class="info2">
  <p class="para2">Using cloud computing services, subscribers access online resources through workstations, laptops, tablets, and smartphones that are configured to protect the data and assets hosted on the cloud. With a pay-as-you-go model, cloud services offer a low-cost way to accommodate spikes in demand more efficiently than in-house computing services.</p>

  <p class="para3">Providers offer subscribers the use of their software running on a cloud infrastructure, which means the application can be widely distributed and accessed. Common types of business technologies hosted by the SaaS vendor include productivity suites, customer relationship management (CRM) software, human resources management (HRM) software, and data management software.  </p>
