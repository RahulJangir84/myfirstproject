            Frontend Development:
        <div class="BELOW1">
            A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allow users to access and interact with the site or app. When you visit a website, the design elements you see were created by a front-end developer.

        Backend Development:
        <div class="BELOW2">
            Back-end developers are the experts who build and maintain the mechanisms that process data and perform actions on websites. Unlike front-end developers, who control everything you can see on a website, back-end developers are involved in data storage, security, and other server-side functions that you cannot see.

    <div class="below3">
        Database Integration:
        <div class="BELOW3">
            Database integration combines and consolidates information from various sources, including databases, cloud storage, data warehouses, on-prem hardware storage, and more. This approach makes data accessible across applications, departments, and stakeholders without the risk of data loss or duplication.
